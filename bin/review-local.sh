# review-local.sh — Local equivalent of the GH-Actions review + maintenance
# workflow orchestration. Saves Action minutes when private repos hit
# the GH-Actions budget cap; same verdict extraction + combined gate +
# L3-evidence check + auto-approve as `review.yml` + `maintenance.yml`.
#
# This script is ADDITIVE: the GH-Actions workflows are unchanged. Use
# this when you want to run the same review pipeline locally without
# consuming a GitHub Actions run.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/review-local.sh --pr N
#   bin/review-local.sh --pr N --provider anthropic
#   bin/review-local.sh --pr N --auto-approve
#   bin/review-local.sh --pr N --review-only
#   bin/review-local.sh --pr N --maintenance-only --dry-run
#   bin/review-local.sh --pr N --injection-only
#   bin/review-local.sh --pr N --no-injection-scan
#   bin/review-local.sh --help
#
# Flags:
#   --pr N                PR number to review (required).
#   --provider NAME       minimax | anthropic | deepseek (default: from
#                         .env:CI_REVIEW_PROVIDER via lib/ci_setup.read_provider).
#                         Applied BEFORE the API key is resolved so the
#                         flag always wins, even on a process env that
#                         has the .env provider's key already loaded.
#   --auto-approve        Cast `gh pr review --approve` when combined
#                         verdict = Approve AND L3-evidence gate passes
#                         AND PR touches production code AND every
#                         enabled judge produced a parseable verdict.
#                         A missing/empty verdict REFUSES auto-approve
#                         (a gate that approves when its input is missing
#                         is worse than no gate). Default: OFF.
#   --review-only         Run only /dev-kit:review (skip security + maintenance).
#   --security-only       Run only /dev-kit:security.
#   --maintenance-only    Run only /dev-kit:maintenance.
#   --injection-only      Run only the deterministic prompt-injection
#                         pre-gate (skips all three LLM judges). Useful
#                         as a fast pre-merge sanity check on a fork PR
#                         before paying the cost of the LLM fan-out.
#                         Same engine as .github/workflows/review.yml
#                         `injection_scan` job.
#   --no-injection-scan    Skip the deterministic pre-gate even when the
#                         other gates run. Off by default; turn it on
#                         only for local debugging — the gate is cheap
#                         and catches hostile PRs before the LLM judges
#                         are invoked.
#   --all                 Run all three (default).
#   --no-touch-probe      Treat every PR as production-touching (skip
#                         the auto-detect file-path probe) but STILL
#                         run the L3-evidence pytest-tail regex. The
#                         flag does not disable the gate; it disables
#                         only the upstream detection. Default: auto-detect.
#   --dry-run             Print the planned env + commands + verdict post
#                         WITHOUT invoking `claude` or `gh pr review`.
#                         Useful for CI-budget planning + smoke tests.
#   -h, --help            Show this help.
#
# Verdict extraction model:
#   The script captures each `claude -p "$prompt"` invocation's stdout
#   into a per-skill variable, then pipes that variable directly into
#   `python3 -m lib.maintenance_gate --extract-verdict-from-stdin`.
#   This is the same helper the workflow shells out to (so the
#   extractor stays single-sourced). It is more robust than reading
#   PR comments because local `claude -p` has no `claude[bot]` login
#   to filter on, and the workflow's per-job extraction relied on
#   temporal locality (each job's judge was its own "last comment")
#   which a sequential local run cannot replicate.
#
#   The agent still posts inline comments directly via `gh pr comment`
#   for the human reviewer; the captured stdout is for the gate only.
#
# Provider switch (matches bin/set-provider.sh + the workflow's choice
# list). The corresponding API key must be in `.env` or the process env
# under the key name `lib/ci_setup.required_secrets_for_provider()` returns,
# e.g. `MINIMAX_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.

#      or in a plugin cache, as long as the user is cd'd into a repo).
#   2. Fall back to BASH_SOURCE's git toplevel -- covers the case
#      where the user runs the script from OUTSIDE the repo (e.g. smoke
#      test from /tmp). The script then finds the repo by walking up
#      from its own location.
# The previous BASH_SOURCE-only derivation hardcoded `<repo>/bin/` and
# failed when the script was symlinked or copied into a non-git directory
# (e.g. plugin cache without a .git marker).

# process loads the slash commands (/dev-kit:review, /dev-kit:security,
# /dev-kit:maintenance). Without it the slash commands resolve to
# "Unknown command" and the gate silently defaults to Approve. The

# `bin/ci-claude-p.sh:200` for the canonical reference implementation.
#
# HARD FAIL (not warn) when the manifest is missing. A prior version
# of this check only warned and let execution continue into
# `claude -p --plugin-dir <incomplete source>`, which reproduces the
# exact #727 regression this script exists to fix: the slash commands
# resolve to "Unknown command", no `**Verdict:**` line appears, and
# the lenient-default logic (see extract_verdict below) silently maps
# the empty verdict to Approve. A fix that only works when the
# operator's plugin source happens to be intact is not a fix -- it
# narrows the trigger condition. Real consumer installs DO ship the
# plugin directory; a missing manifest here means a broken/partial

# Approve. (Local judge finding F1, PR #741.)

# SIGALRM-based timeout. The bash + background-watchdog pattern has
# subtle orphan-sleep semantics under bash 3.2 (the watchdog subshell's
# `sleep` grandchildren survive `kill -KILL` on the subshell PID and
# make the trailing `wait` block until the full timeout elapses) --
# perl's `alarm` + `waitpid` avoids all of that.
