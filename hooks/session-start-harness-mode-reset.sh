# fast/custom mode must be chosen explicitly every session, never inherited
# from a previous one. Best-effort: a missing python3 or unwritable .dev-kit/
# is not a hard failure (lib.harness_mode_state.read_state() already treats a
# missing/corrupt file as mode=full, so silently skipping here is still safe).
