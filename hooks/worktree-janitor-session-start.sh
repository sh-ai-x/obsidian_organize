# worktree-janitor-session-start.sh — SessionStart hook (issue #717).
#
# Read-only nudge that surfaces orphan worktrees at session start. Counts
# worktrees whose branch is reachable from origin/main (merged) or whose
# branch matches `fix/classify-request-*` and is older than 7 days
# (orphans from the auto-classify pipeline) and prints a single line via
# `additionalContext` so the operator knows to consider
# `bin/worktree-prune.sh --dry-run`.
#
# NEVER deletes. The user-invoked `bin/worktree-prune.sh --apply` is the
# only mutation surface, and it explicitly requires --apply before doing
# anything.
#
# Opt-out: DEV_KIT_JANITOR_OFF=1 makes the hook a silent no-op (mirrors
# the opt-out pattern in `bin/review-local.sh` /
# `bin/babysit-pr-local.sh`).
#
# Fails open with a stderr warning when `jq` is missing — same posture
# as `session-start-check.sh` (advisory, not blocking).
#
# Only nudges when the session is starting in a worktree. Main-checkout
# sessions see the same probe but skipping the nudge avoids noise (the
# main session is rarely where prune decisions are made).

# Source the shared preamble (set -uo pipefail, INPUT=$(cat),
# worktree_detect, jq-missing warning).
