# bash-guard.sh — PreToolUse hook for Bash. Blocks destructive commands.
#
# Two tiers, because "destructive" is not one category:
#
#   CATASTROPHIC — unrecoverable, no legitimate agent use case.
#     Always hard-denies. Ignores DEV_KIT_STRICT *and* the stage gate.
#     `rm -rf /` is never correct in any stage of any workflow, so
#     gating it behind either switch is indefensible.
#
#   RECOVERABLE — destructive but sometimes legitimate (git reset --hard
#     on your own branch, docker system prune on a dev box). Advisory by
#     default; hard-denies under DEV_KIT_STRICT=1. Stage-gated, so it
#     only speaks up in the stages where the matrix enables bash-guard.
#
# Why the tier split (this file's history): a single flat list gated on
# DEV_KIT_STRICT meant the default install printed a warning for `rm -rf /`
# and then EXECUTED IT. Worse, bash-guard is stage-gated off everywhere
# except `build` (lib/active_hooks_codec.py), so even DEV_KIT_STRICT=1 left
# `rm -rf /` unguarded in the other six stages. The catastrophic tier is
# checked before the stage gate for exactly that reason.
#
# Root-subpath + `--` separator coverage (B1/B2, review on commit d3476e9):
# the original bare-root pattern (`rm -rf /` followed by space-or-end) let
# `rm -rf /etc`, `rm -rf /usr/local/bin`, and `rm -rf -- /` through
# unguarded — each at least as destructive as the bare-root case the tier
# exists to catch. Fixed by widening the pattern to system-directory
# subpaths (any depth) plus the canonical `--` end-of-flags form; /home
# and /root only deny on an exact top-level hit so routine absolute-path
# cleanup under a user's own directory still works.

set -eo pipefail
# Use %/* parameter expansion (POSIX, no external `dirname` required) so
# the source line still works when PATH is broken (jq-less test envs
# strip dirname along with jq — see TestBashGuardRefactor.fails_closed).
