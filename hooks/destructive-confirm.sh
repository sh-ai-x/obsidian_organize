# destructive-confirm.sh — PreToolUse "ask" gate for destructive-but-legitimate ops.
#
# The third tier of the guard stack. The other two already existed:
#
#   bash-guard / git-guard  → deny   (block outright, agent must reroute)
#   silent exit 0           → allow  (invisible to the human)
#
# ...which left no way to say "this is probably fine, but a human should
# see it first." Before this hook, the repo had ZERO uses of Claude Code's
# `permissionDecision: "ask"` — the only mechanism that surfaces a
# confirmation prompt to the user before a tool runs. Every destructive
# action was therefore either hard-denied or executed silently.
#
# Covers three classes:
#
#   1. Credential/key file writes (.env, *.pem, id_rsa, .aws/credentials).
#      A deny would be wrong — writing .env.example or rotating a local
#      key is legitimate. Silent-allow is how a secret gets committed.
#   2. Bare `git worktree remove`, which bypasses bin/worktree-remove-safe.sh
#      and therefore discards the worktree's logs/ tree instead of archiving
#      it. The safe wrapper was previously enforced by convention only.
#   3. First-time branch push (`git push -u`) and force-with-lease. Neither
#      is catastrophic; both are externally visible.
#
# NOT stage-gated: an ask costs one keystroke and never blocks a correct
# action, so there is no stage where suppressing it is worth the risk.
# Fails closed on missing jq (inherited from require_jq).
