"""Tests for templates/ci/scripts/extract-verdict.py.

Verifies the verdict extraction contract that review.yml + security
post-steps rely on (issue #244, boilerplate-web PR #19 verification;
issue #612, consumer silent-Approve bug; issue #625, MINIMAX provider
drops assistant stream):

  1. Missing file     → exit 0, empty stdout
  2. HTML file        → exit 0, empty stdout (network error page)
  3. JSONL no verdict → exit 0, prints "PARSE_FAILED" (issue #612)
  4. JSONL one Approve verdict → exit 0, prints "Approve"
  5. JSONL two verdicts (last wins) → exit 0, prints last verdict
  6. Bad usage        → exit 2 (missing arg)

Issue #612 contract: distinguish "I couldn't read the file"
(missing / HTML / unreadable / suspiciously small → stdout="") from
"the file existed but had no recognizable `Verdict:` line"
(stout="PARSE_FAILED"). The latter is hard-failed by the severity
gate so a real review failure can't be papered over as Approve.

Issue #625 contract: when the execution-file verdict is empty OR
PARSE_FAILED AND a PR-comments file is provided as the second arg,
fall back to scanning that file for `Verdict: <value>` lines. The
caller is responsible for filtering by run_id (defeats #244 stale-
comment flap). The file verdict still wins when present.

#
#   - top-level `result` string  (the canonical MINIMAX envelope)
#   - top-level `content` list of text blocks  (alternative wrapper)
#   - nested `message.content` list of text blocks  (the claude-code SDK
#     shape the parser already supported — sanity-check it still works
#     on a result-type message that uses the SDK shape)
#
# Pre-#625 the parser only scanned `type=assistant` messages, so the

# hard-failing the severity gate. These tests pin the post-#625 contract.

# Two distinct P1 findings from the #625 review:
#   1. `_extract_texts()` does `msg.get("message", {}).get(...)`, which
#      crashes with AttributeError when `message` is None / a string /
#      a number — contradicting the docstring's "Never raises" contract.
#      The widened `type=result` trust is precisely the case where the
#      envelope shape is unknown by definition.
#   2. The widened `type=result` trust must NOT swallow aborted runs
#      that carry `is_error: true` or `subtype: error_max_turns` /
#      `error_during_execution`. Such messages can carry a partial
#      summary that happens to contain `Verdict: Approve` (emitted
#      before the agent was cut off), and trusting them would let an
#      aborted run slip through the gate (a regression of the
#      pre-#625 behaviour where such runs resolved to PARSE_FAILED).
